Hi! Welcome to my cs1420 repo. This is more of an archive for my labs and projects I've completed throughout this class.

*Please, if you're a fellow student looking for code to plagiarize, I beg you to reconsider. There a plenty of online resources that you can utilize. I recommended Stack Overflow, the reference libraries for [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ref/Reference.html), [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/), and [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).*
